# mobile/CLAUDE.md

React Native + Expo app for zuhd.news. Voice + philosophy in root `../foundation.md`.

`npm run verify` — typecheck + lint + test in one command; run before finishing.

## Before touching UI

**Read `DESIGN.md`.** It defines the token system, `<Text>` variants, primitives, and anti-patterns. The rules are tight by design — don't re-litigate them.

## Non-negotiables

- No NativeWind / Unistyles / Tamagui / Restyle. Vanilla StyleSheet + `useTheme()` is the committed approach. Matches the root "no framework" philosophy and the Globe 32ms perf budget.
- No inline hex codes. Colors come from `useTheme().colors` or a `tone` prop.
- No inline `fontSize`. Use `<Text variant>` from `components/primitives/`.
- No raw `<Ionicons>` — go through `<Icon>`.
- One typeface: Source Sans 3. No second family.

## Primitives live at

`mobile/components/primitives/` — `Text`, `Stack`, `Box`, `Screen`, `Pressable`, `IconButton`, `Icon`. Import from `./primitives`.

## Tokens live at

`mobile/constants/theme.ts` — add a new variant here with a JSDoc justifying the role; migrate call sites; update `DESIGN.md`.

## When a variant isn't quite right

Prefer the `scale` prop on `<Text>` over style overrides. `fontVariant` overrides (tabular-nums, oldstyle-nums) are OK as style overrides — they're orthogonal. Font family overrides (`font.bold`, `font.regular`) are an escape hatch; document them with a comment.

## Perf reminders

- Globe touches a 32ms JS budget; don't regress `callReproject` throttling.
- Reanimated animations gate on `useReducedMotion()` and battery saver — check before changing timings.
- React Compiler is enabled in dev-client and production builds. New code should
  default to plain functions/components; add manual `memo`, `useMemo`, or
  `useCallback` only for effect/third-party identity or a measured hot path.
