# mobile/CLAUDE.md

React Native + Expo app for zuhd.news. Voice + philosophy in root `../foundation.md`.

`npm run verify` — typecheck + lint + test in one command; run before finishing.

## Before touching UI

**Read `DESIGN.md`.** It defines the token system, `<Text>` variants, primitives, and anti-patterns. The rules are tight by design — don't re-litigate them.

## Non-negotiables

- No NativeWind / Unistyles / Tamagui / Restyle. Vanilla StyleSheet + `useTheme()` is the committed approach. Matches the root "no framework" philosophy and the Globe 32ms perf budget.
- No inline hex codes. Colors come from `useTheme().colors` or a `tone` prop.
- No inline `fontSize`. Use `<Text variant>` from `components/primitives/`.
- No raw `<Ionicons>` — go through `<Icon>`.
- One typeface: Source Sans 3. No second family.
- **Gestures use the Gesture Handler 3 hook API** — `usePanGesture({…})`,
  `useTapGesture({…})`, `useCompetingGestures(a, b)` — never the v2 builder
  chain. `Gesture.Pan()` is still exported and `GestureDetector` still accepts
  what it returns: it detects a builder gesture and quietly routes it to the
  *legacy* detector. So the old API compiles, runs, and silently opts that one
  gesture out of the new native pipeline — which is the whole reason the app
  moved. Nothing will warn you.

  The callback names changed with it: `onStart` → `onActivate`, `onEnd` →
  `onDeactivate`, `onChange` → `onUpdate` (`changeX`/`changeY` ride along on
  the update event now), and a tap's old `onEnd((e, success) => …)` is
  `onDeactivate` plus the `canceled` flag the end event carries. `onBegin` and
  `onFinalize` keep their names but get the *plain* handler data — `translationX`
  and `velocityX` exist only on the extended data the middle three receive.

  Keep the config object in a `useMemo`. The hook owns the handler tag, so
  there is no gesture object to keep stable any more, but a fresh config
  identity re-pushes the whole config to the native side on every render.

## Dependencies Expo does not manage

`react-native-gesture-handler` is pinned **off** the SDK 57 set (3.1.0 vs the
prescribed ~2.32.0) and listed in `expo.install.exclude` so `expo install
--fix` — which `npm run deps:update` runs — cannot drag it back. Both its
in-tree dependents accept it (`expo-router` peers `*` optional,
`react-native-drawer-layout` peers `>= 2.0.0`), so there is one deduped copy,
which matters: two copies would mean two native gesture registries.

`expo install --check` will keep reporting `react-native`, `react-native-reanimated`
and `react-native-worklets` as behind the SDK pin. That is deliberate and
predates this: builds 288/289 shipped the pinned set (0.86.2 / 4.5.1 / 0.10.1)
and crashed on launch anyway.

## Primitives live at

`mobile/components/primitives/` — `Text`, `Stack`, `Box`, `Screen`, `Pressable`, `IconButton`, `Icon`. Import from `./primitives`.

## Tokens live at

`mobile/constants/theme.ts` — add a new variant here with a JSDoc justifying the role; migrate call sites; update `DESIGN.md`.

## When a variant isn't quite right

Prefer the `scale` prop on `<Text>` over style overrides. `fontVariant` overrides (tabular-nums, oldstyle-nums) are OK as style overrides — they're orthogonal. Font family overrides (`font.bold`, `font.regular`) are an escape hatch; document them with a comment.

## Perf reminders

- Globe touches a 32ms JS budget; don't regress `callReproject` throttling.
- Reanimated animations gate on `useReducedMotion()` and battery saver — check before changing timings.
- React Compiler is **installed but NOT enabled** — in any build. The only
  switch is `app.json` → `experiments.reactCompiler`, which flows
  CLI → Metro `customTransformOptions.reactCompiler` → babel caller
  `supportsReactCompiler` → `babel-preset-expo`. That key is absent, so the
  plugin is dropped (`babel-preset-expo/build/configs/expo.js:135`). The
  `'react-compiler'` option in `babel.config.js` only *configures* or
  *disables* (`=== false`); it can never enable.
  Consequence: the ~320 manual `memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback` sites are
  load-bearing today, not redundant — do not strip them on the assumption the
  compiler covers them. To actually turn it on, add
  `"reactCompiler": true` to `app.json` experiments, and add a `'use no memo'`
  directive to `components/globe/MiniGlobe.tsx` first: it relies on
  intentionally-stale `useCallback(..., [])` closures (three `biome-ignore`
  comments mark them) that the compiler would otherwise rewrite.
